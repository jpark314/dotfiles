# dotfiles

I'm using zsh as my default shell for both Mac and Linux (Ubuntu and Arch/Majaro) and vim as my primary text editor

I'm also trying to get used to emacs, because, well...what do you say, real developers use emacs for some reason (heard this phrase from a friend, not my idea)

I'll be updating my dotfiles accordingly whenever I make changes (It's a good habit to keep track of everything and sharing for other developers)

This may include small changes like adding comments and paths to a major overhaul

* Installing tagbar

  Need to install universal ctags first
use: brew install --HEAD universal-ctags/universal-ctags/universal-ctags for Mac

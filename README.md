# dotfiles

I use zsh as my default shell for both Mac and Linux (Ubuntu and Arch/Majaro) and vim as my primary text editor

I'm also trying to get used to emacs, because, well...what do you say, real developers use emacs for some reason (heard
it from a friend, not my idea)

I'll be updating my dotfiles accordingly whenever I make changes
This may include small changes like adding comments and paths to a major overhaul
